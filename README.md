# ContextApiselfpractisestuff
All Context API self practise stuff here

1) we have created floder i.e. Context and then 2 files i.e. NoteContext.js and NoteState.jsx 2) for file Appijs we have added between <NoteState> all file(Login, profile)</NoteState> i.e this means all date/value will be added/state managed so that props drilling can be ignored/reduce usage 3) Login.jsx here we can added/give/fill details and it will be directly stored in notestate.js file 4) In Profile.jsx file we can get/fetch/display details from NoteState.jsx this can be opened from any child file.
